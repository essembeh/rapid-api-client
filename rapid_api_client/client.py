"""
Client classes for the rapid-api-client library.

This module provides the core classes for building API clients:
- RapidApi: Base class for API clients
- ParameterManager: Manages parameters for API requests
- RapidParameter: Represents a function parameter with its annotation

These classes handle the extraction of parameters from function signatures,
the resolution of path templates, and the building of HTTP requests.
They work together with the decorator module to provide a declarative way
to define API clients.

    Base class for API clients.

    This class represents an API client. Subclasses should define methods
    decorated with @http (or @get, @post, etc.) which represent API endpoints.

    Example:
        >>> from rapid_api_client import RapidApi, get, post
        >>> from typing import Annotated
        >>>
        >>> class MyApi(RapidApi):
